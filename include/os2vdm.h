/* From Undocumented DOS: 2nd ed.

FSFILTER is just a DOS device driver that hooks INT 21h. How then does it communicate with the OS/2 kernel?
Disassembly of FSFILTER reveals some calls to INT 66h, with AX«I and SI pointing to strings such
as VCOM, VDISK, and VLPT. However, this doesn't seem sufficient for a DOS
device driver mining at Ring 3 in V86 mode to communicate with OS2KRNL. running 
at Ring 0 in protected mode, FSFILTER uses HLT instruction to communicate with OS2KRNL,

We asked one of the IBM MVDM engineers how this works:

HLT is our magic pill

ing 8, 4 tap occurs, A part of OS2KRNL called EM86 (Emulation 8086) receives the fault
and takes action. EM86 looks at the registers and the _two_bytes_following_the_HLT_ and
determines that this special request and not a real HLT instruction, The cove ses

The HLT instruction is a Ring 0 instruction; since V86 mode is
a SVC xxx macro, where xxx ts the ordinal number of the function
to call in OS2KRNL; the dispatcher in MVDM (part of OS2KRNL) knows 
all the valid xxx calls

‘Many opcodes that 8086 provides are now Ring 0 only, and EM86 emulates 
the 8086 actions of these privileged instructions, If a special request HLT
is found, MVDM (also part of OS2KRNL) is given the request for dispatching
and action. There is a second magic pill EM86 uses, the ARPL instruction.
VDD stubs use the ARPL; DOSKRNL and FSFILTER

More similarities to Windows! Windows Enhanced mode uses ARPL, for the
same reasons, in the Install_V86_Break Point function. Later on we'll
see that DOS device drivers running under Windows NT can use a very
similar mechanism, invahd opcodes, for communicating with NT VDDs,

Even though OS/2 can use FSFILTER to run actual DOS in V86 mode,
emulating DOS is preferable, For one thing, running an actual copy
of DOS makes it more difficult to control polling in the DOS kernel,
which wastes cycles. In addition, FSFILTER must catch DOS calls at a
lower level than the normal DOS emulation code.
*/

/* 
  According above info, to find all 0xF4 xx yy sequences in
  DOSKRNL and FSFILTER.SYS small script was born. After
  small deduction: yy=not xx.
  
  So, SVC macro is something like this

	SVC	MACRO xx
		HLT
		DB	xx, not xx
		ENDM
	
	Seems it so.
	
	Minimal opcode xx is 0. Maximal (in DOSKRNL) - 0x55 or (in FSFILTER.SYS) - 0x4F.
	
	For now only known opcode is a 02h (thanks to RBIL).
