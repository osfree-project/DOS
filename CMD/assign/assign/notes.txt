1. assign doesn't work under dosbox command.com

3. FreeDOS assign on many functions calls GetTime function. WTF?

3. Need to update OSO001.H:

#define E_hlpScreen "ASSIGN: Replace a drive letter by another.\n\r \
\n\r \
usage: %s [/SHADOW] /STATUS\n\r \
or:    [/SHADOW] [/{mu}] [{dr1[:]=dr2[:]}]\n\r \
\n\r \
Options:\n\r \
       SHADOW: Hide ASSIGN from installation check.\n\r \
       STATUS: Display all assigned drive letters.\n\r \
               If ASSIGN is not already loaded, a message reflects that,\n\r \
               but ASSIGN is not loaded.\n\r \
       M: Move the resident portion into UMB, if possible.\n\r \
       U: Uninstall a previous installed ASSIGN.\n\r \
\n\r \
dr1: Drive letter to be replaced.\n\r \
dr2: Drive letter to point to.\n\r \
\n\r \
The ':' characters are optional, between the drive letters and the \n\r \
equal sign '=' no whitespaces are allowed."
